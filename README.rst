This component provides `SQLAlchemy`_ integration for the Asphalt framework.

SQLAlchemy is a library for working with relational databases.
It offers both an ORM (`Object Relational Mapper`_) and a "core" API that both abstract away
many of the differences in various SQL dialects. It also includes powerful facilities to
dynamically construct and execute database queries.
