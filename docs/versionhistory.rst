Version history

**3.0.0** (2017-04-16)

- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Migrated to Asphalt 3.0
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Engine resources are no longer directly accessible as context
  variables. Instead, every engine gets its own session and can be accessed via the session's
  ``bind`` variable.
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** The component now longer accepts bare ``Connection`` objects to be
  added as resources
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** The commit executor is now configured on the component level
- An explicit commit executor is now always used (a new one will be created implicitly if none is
  defined in the configuration)
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Session configuration can no longer be disabled (no more
  ``session=False``)
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Engines can no longer be bound to ``MetaData`` objects
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Renamed the ``asphalt.sqlalchemy.util`` module to
  ``asphalt.sqlalchemy.utils``

- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed all asynchronous API extensions (``asphalt.sqlalchemy.async``)
